# arpa2cm

CMake module library for ARPA2. Like the KDE Extra CMake Modules (ECM)
which is a large-ish collection of curated CMake modules of particular
interest to Qt-based and KDE Frameworks-based applications, the ARPA2
CMake Modules (ARPA2CM) is a collection of modules for the software
stack from the ARPA2 project. This is largely oriented towards
TLS, SSL, X509, DER and LDAP technologies. The ARPA2 CMake Modules
also include modules used for product release and deployment of
the ARPA2 software stack.

Some modules in the ARPA2 CM are copied from KDE ECM; this is so
that ARPA2 software only need rely on the ARPA2 CM, instead of
on KDE ECM as well.
